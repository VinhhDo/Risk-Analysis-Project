In the lending industry, investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, the lender profits from the interest. However, if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders would like to minimize the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan.

 <br />In this exercise, we will use publicly available data from Lending Club, a platform that connects borrowers and investors online. The dataset is available in the loans.csv file. There are 9,578 observations, each representing a 3-year loan that was funded through the Lendingclub.com platform from past data. There are 14 variables in the dataset, described in the Table below.

<br />Executives at this company have hired you as a data science consultant to identify the factors that lead to customers fully paying the loan. In essence, this exercise aims to predict/classify NotFullyPaid, using all of the other variables as independent variables.
