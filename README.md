In the lending industry, investors provide loans to borrowers in exchange for the promise of repayment with interest. If the borrower repays the loan, the lender profits from the interest. However, if the borrower is unable to repay the loan, then the lender loses money. Therefore, lenders would like to minimize the risk of a borrower being unable to repay a loan.

 <br />In this exercise, we will use publicly available data from Lending Club, a platform that connects borrowers and investors online. The dataset is available in the loans.csv file. There are 9,578 observations, each representing a 3-year loan that was funded through the Lendingclub.com platform from past data. There are 14 variables in the dataset, described in the Table below.

## Objective 
#### • What factors contribute to loans not being fully paid based on exploratory analysis? 
#### • Build classification models, assess their performance, identify the variables most important in determining whether the loans will be fully paid up based on models, and choose the best model based on the performance metrics
#### • Based on insights from data mining, providing solutions for the lending.club to limit loan default.
